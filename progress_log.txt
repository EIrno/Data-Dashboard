1. Sprint

added:
- basic api functionality
- parser for the api data
- initial structure for the UI
- graph with data from the api

tested:
nada

errors and solutions:
- I didn't use the right date type initially. I switched to java.time and that solved the issues
- Getting familiar with the scalafx graphs was time-consuming

workload:
under 10 hours? I didn't really use that  much time neither did I track it properly. I will track my time better for the next sprint.

schedule:
I think I am in a pretty good pace with my project. Kinda lagging, because in my own opinion I could have done so much more.




2. Sprint

goals:
- finishing api and parser
- creating the Dashboard class
- creating other ui components
